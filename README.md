#Description:
Number Guesser is a simple game in which a player may specify a given minimum
and maximum number range and the browser will generate a random number for the
player to guess. Upon successfully guessing the correct randomly generated number,
the range of numbers is increased. The game will validate that a user successfully
selects a numerical value for both the min and max numbers as well as a guess.

This project is largely intended to explore the use of JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS
within a Rails environment.



#To get started:

The app was originally created with Rails 5.2.1. and the instructions were as follows:
Download the files and navigate to the root directory. Run `rails s` from the terminal.
Navigate to your favorite browser and go to "localhost:3000/".

#Special Note:
